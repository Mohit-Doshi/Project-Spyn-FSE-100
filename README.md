# Project-Spyn-FSE-100

JAMM Motors presents the HoneyBadger®️ for Project Spyn. The HoneyBadger is a car that demonstrates autonomous navigation within a maze and can pickup and dropoff a passenger and is disabled-friendly too. It includes a color sensor, an ultrasonic sensor, and touch sensors. The HoneyBadger was built using the Lego Mindstorm EV3 kit and was programmed entirely on Matlab. It employs the Wall follower maze algorithm. 

JAMM Motors is the team that I was a part of for my FSE 100 class. The car had the fastest timing of 1 minute and 57 seconds among 11 groups. 

JAMM Motors is comprised of Jacob Andrus, Anirudh Chinepalli, Michael Galvan, and myself. 

Jacob designed and built the entire car from scratch and contributed to some of the source code.
Michael was the chief coder on the team and wrote most of the code and also developed a lot of the logic.
I coded some of the sensors, part of the logic for the delays. My role was more focused on documentation/submissions and testing/error reporting.
